I'm currently a research assistant in [AIoT Lab](https://aiot.ie.cuhk.edu.hk). I work on AI-powered wireless sensing and health systems with privacy-preserving technologies.

I'm also interested in systems for AI, distributed systems, and database storage. I am currently looking for PhD opportunities. If you are interested in my experience, please feel free to contact me!
